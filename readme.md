# Path Planning

Simple path planning algorithm that navigates around a random obstacle.  The
algorithm utilizes a Genetic Algorithm with a population, mutation, and crossover
occurring that attempts to model the real world.  This projects was inspired by
and developed using models by [Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz7mv2vD6g).


## Motivation
Developed a more complex version of Daniel Shiffman's video utilizing the Java
language and [Processing enviornment](https://processing.org/) to visualize how
a genetic algorithm is working.

## Technologies
- Java
- Processing
